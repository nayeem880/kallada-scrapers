From now on can we try working on one part and getting it to be fully working before moving to the next set of functionality. This way me and my partner also would get to test things and suggest you the changes immediately.

For now I can see that you have implemented adding projects and Find Opportunities (around 30-50%). Can we now focus on getting a UI like the screenshots I sent you for adding projects and Find Opportunities. For finding opportunity(Website list scraping) can you please check the previous programs logic. As of now from what I can see, when user gives a keyword , the script just searches for that keyword in Google and scraps results from first 3 pages. But thats not how we want the program to work.

Lets say that user gives the following 2 keywords when creating projects: yoga training, meditation
You should combine this keyword with search operators:
keyword intitle:”write for us”
keyword intitle:”write for me”
Keyword  intitle:”contribute to”
Keyword intitle:”submit” + inurl:blog
Keyword “submit a guest post”
Keyword inurl:/guest-post/
Keyword “guest post”
Keyword “guest post by”
Keyword “accepting guest posts”
Keyword “guest post guidelines”
Keyword “guest author”
Keyword “guest article”
Keyword “guest column”
Keyword “become a contributor”
inpostauthor:guest keyword
inpostauthor:”guest blog” keyword
inpostauthor:”guest post” keyword

So there are 17 search operators above. Keyword should be replaced by the keyword entered by the user.. So in the above case you should search in Google for :
yoga training intitle:”write for us”
yoga training intitle:”write for me”
yoga training intitle:”contribute to”
etc

meditation intitle:”write for us”
meditation intitle:”write for me”
meditation intitle:”contribute to”
etc

Hope its clear. Please check the Bloggerhit program to see the exact search operators we are using
